•	All the four dataset gzip files(1990.gz,1991.gz,1992.gz,1993.gz) should be in the /all directory. 

•	The script for AWK executes these datasets from the /all folder under the home directory, so place all the gzip files are in the /all directory.

•	The AWK script file should also be placed under the /all file under the /home directory, so that it can pickup all the datasets.

•	The script is run by using the “time ./ max_temperature.sh” command. The CPU time consumed to run the script is calculated using the time command and the whole command returns the maximum temperature based on the year along with the time taken to calculate it.

•	For Scenario one, only the dataset 1990.gz is required, hence move only 1990.gz to the /all folder. Make sure all the other datasets are not present in the /all folder. 

•	For Scenario two, only the datasets 1990.gz and 1992.gz are required, hence move only the 1990.gz and the 1992.gz files to the /all directory. Make sure all the other datasets are not present in the /all folder. 

•	For Scenario three, all the datasets(1990.gz,1991.gz,1992.gz,1993.gz) should be inside the /all directory.
